	<p> The YouTube video named Humans Need Not Apply has made me wonder a bunch of questions such as, if 90% of the job in the existance no longer exist, what will happen to society? Technology is advancing every second of every day, eventually technology is slowly going to take over the world. Robots have been created with the new technology that has been discovered, they have taken over low skill jobs. I'm afraid of what will happen in the future, would robots be made for good or for evil? Are Robots going to be built smarter than humans? And what exactly would happen to humans? I defenitly don't want to see robots walking down the street! </p>

	<h2>Watch The Video!</h2>
