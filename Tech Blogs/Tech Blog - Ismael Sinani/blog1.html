	<h2>My Response</h2>
	
	<p> I believe that in the future robots will be able to replace us in any single way. Knowing that A.I is always advancing as the time goes by, in the near future it is a possibility that they can out-smart us. It is possible that we will become too dependent on them that they won't need us and can function without our help. </p>
