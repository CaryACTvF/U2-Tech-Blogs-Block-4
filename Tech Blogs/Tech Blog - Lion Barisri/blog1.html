	<h1>What will happen to your job?</h1>
	<h2>As the future become more advance.</h2>
<body>

 	<p>I think people are over exaggerating the negative affects of robots replacing human. To me, it's no different from the industrial revolution, the only difference is the how advanced we have become. If the human's jobs were to be taken, then they could be taught how to work in the jobs that are available, just like how people were taught how to work with the machines in the industrial revolution. The future shouldn't be something that people are scared of and trying to opposed, the future will show that we have advance and we will always evolve. </p>
