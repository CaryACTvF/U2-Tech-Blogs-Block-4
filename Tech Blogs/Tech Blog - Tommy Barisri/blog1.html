	<h2 class="box" id="boxed"> My Response to Humans Need Not to Apply</h2>

	<img src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/237586/original/file-20180923-117383-1d2tv74.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1200&h=1200.0&fit=crop" height="360">

	<p class="box">After viewing Humans Need Not to Apply, I have relize that this is good and bad because simple jobs will be taken over by robots with AI, which is bad for the humans because humans need to be dependent on these jobs for income, however this is really beneficial for companies who just what to pay a single person to monitor the robot instead of paying many people to do a single job. If every job was replaced by  robots from the humans it would be WALL E all over again and if robots start to conquer the world and the end. </p>

	<p class="box">Comment by Ashley Donofrio: I agree that there are both pros and cons for robots taking over. However, I believe there are more cons than pros because 95% of jobs will be taken over by them, and only a smal % will still thrive. I also like your reference to the movie walle. I think you should elaborate on why it connects to the movie if someone reading doesn't know the movie. I like your presentation, however, you should change the color of the text because it is hard to read with the background. Also, you need to center your image and add google fonts, and you'll be good! </p>
