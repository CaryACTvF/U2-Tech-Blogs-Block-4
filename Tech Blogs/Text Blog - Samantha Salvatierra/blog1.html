<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tecnology is changing and advancing every moment of every single day. It is amazing to think technology has come so far. Transportation was impacted by the technological advancements of cars. Before cars people had to rely on horses. Horses were a main source but they were unreliable. This benefits both humans and horses because of how horses are not used inhumanely and cars are a more reliable and easier mode of transportation. Cars have been getting more and more advanced that there are even self driving cars which can protect people from accidents due to texting while driving and drunk driving. Robots are become more reliable and realistic. Robots are now not just considered a "toy" but a significant tool in creating a better working environment. With the new technology we may not need people to do simple/under skilled jobs which leads people to expand their own job experience and do something more.</p>
