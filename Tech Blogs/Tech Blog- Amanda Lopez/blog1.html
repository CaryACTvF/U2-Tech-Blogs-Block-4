	<h2>How Do We Recover?</h2>
	<img src="">
	<p> Technology should scare many people, soon they will be have the mentality of a human and soon do the things we workhard for. people will invest in robots because it would be a lot cheaper than paying millions of workers. That exact thing frightens me, what will happen to me or my family i wish to have in the future? I think humans will be paid for things in the entertainment department. People will pay to see others perform or to present their craft.</p>
