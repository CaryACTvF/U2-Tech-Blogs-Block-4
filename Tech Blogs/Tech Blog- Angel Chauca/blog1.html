	<h2>How Much Time?</h2>
	<p> With my knowlegde of robots, we all will lose our jobs and become basic maintenance workers cleaning the robots or left to our own self with nothing. Either that happens or we become exsintic. Though it may not be now or anytime soon it's almost impossible to tell the speific day one robot can store enough info and spit out answer in less then 30 seconds. 
	And when that day come people will try and fight the advancement cause they lost there jobs and will fight back though it's cheapper and quicker to employ a robot then a human that is still open to cause constant mistakes.</p>
	<p>Comment by Samantha Salvatierra: I like your use of different coding techniques (such as centering the images, using bold text etc.) in order to emphasize the importance of this blog. ðŸ™ƒ</p>
