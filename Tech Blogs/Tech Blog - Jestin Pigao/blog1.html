	<p>The thing I saw in the youtube video <b>"Humans Need Not Apply"</b> is that it explains how jobs are being replaced by robots and how we don't apply for all of the jobs such as teachers, scientist, chefs, etc. I don't like how we are replaced by robots and there would be no payment for humans, but only for robots.</p>
	<p>Comment by Akhyar Rahman your tech blog is colorful and very eye attractive when looked by th eye. but the response is a little short but nonethless its overall a good job.</p>
