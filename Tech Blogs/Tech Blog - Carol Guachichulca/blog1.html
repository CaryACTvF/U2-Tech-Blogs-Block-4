	<h2>Humans Need Not Apply</h2>

	<p>What I saw in the video scared me! I've known all my life that technology had been getting much more advanced, but what I didn't really think about is how it would affect us human negatively. It is scary to think about how a robot could take over all our jobs and leave us unemployed, especially if all our lives we're working to get a job and it won't even be possible if robots take over anything. Right now I don't know exactly what I want to be when I get older but I do know that I would want to work and be around people, and hopefully the job I choose stays safe because one thing I do know is that robots aren't able to process emotions. </p>
