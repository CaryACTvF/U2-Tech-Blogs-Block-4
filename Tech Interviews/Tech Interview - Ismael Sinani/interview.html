			<p>I think it's interesting how your uncle and my mom both started using tech around the same age, even though they have more than a 10 year age difference. I like the colors you choose for your blog and how when you hover over the text they change colors.</p>

			<p>You could use more color but still the websites still looks great. My dad also started using computers around his twenties which is pretty cool. The hover effect is pretty cool as well.</p>
