			<h4>Comment by Ashley</h4>
			<p>My mom was also in her 20's when she got her first computer. She also said how watching TV was her favorite part of tech when she was younger. I agree with your dad on how we should aim to get a job in tech because it could help make a difference in society and provides good money.</p>

			<h4>Comment by Ismael</h4>
			<p>Your dad has very similar thoughts as my uncle. He belives that the technology is making peoples jobs easier. I feel as if your dad also believes that the use of technology has made us humans more and more useless as they (technology) do our job for us.</p>
