		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p id="introduction">Alicia Santiago is being interviewed about technology in her life.</p>

		<h2>Interview</h2>
		<ol class="interview">
			<li class="question"> <p> How old were you when you got your first computer?</li>
				<p class="answer"> In middle school, the tomagachi. People were on them all the time, trying to keep your pet alive.</p>
			
			<li class="question"> <p> What was your favorite piece of technology when they were growing up?</li>
				<p class="answer">In middle school, the tomagachi. People were on them all the time, trying to keep your pet alive.</p>

			<li class="question"> <p> How has technology changed over your lifetime?</li>
				<pclass="answer">I think that's it's gotten a lot slicker and more reliable, definitely more faster. Before to get internet you had to get a cd rom and download it. Then start up aol and wait for the dial tone. If you had told me that you could have a computer inside your phone i would've told you you’re lying.</p>

			<li class="question"> <p> Have the changes you’ve seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or hurt society?</li>
				<pclass="answer"> I think it's both, there helpful aspects of technology with the ease of info, if you wanted information you’d have to go to the library for resources. But it lessens the face to face interactions. I see groups of kids hanging out with their friends just purely in the phone.</p>

			<li class="question"> <p> What is your greatest hope for technology in the future?</li>
				<pclass="answer"> I think that we continue to try to make it mostly to help society, using health and science to help people.What could technology continue to do in the future as we make  technological advancements</p>

			<li class="question"> <p> What is your greatest fear for technology in the future?</li>
				<pclass="answer"> That people will talk to each other even less, even less face to face to face interactions.</p>

			<li class="question"> <p> What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about tech- nology?</li>
				<pclass="answer"> Appreciate how good you have out now because the tech has acom a long way in how fast it is. In collge id go to class leave my computer open and when i came back it still wouldnt be downloaded.</p>

			<li class="question"> <p> When are you going to allow your son to have access to technology?</li>
				<pclass="answer"> I think that my husband and I have been talking about limits, now there's actual research about the effects of tablets when your only 1 or 2 years old. Its causing depression and anxiety, but I don't want to limit him completely, when i'd give them access to that.
